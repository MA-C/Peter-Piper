__1. Introduction__
This script was made as an alternative to legitimate authentication in apple script. This script uses a method of exploitation in OS X  called root piping.

` `

__2. Exploit__
This exploit uses a vulnerability that was properly fixed in OS X 10.10.5. Itâ€™s reference information is https://www.sektioneins.de/en/blog/15-07-07-dyld_print_to_file_lpe.html
This exploit gives whatever user that executes it admin instantly.

` `

__3. Install__
We used curl to get Java 8 Update 60 on to the target computer in a temporary directory. Then we used the installer bash command featured in the OS X command line to install the .pkg we fetched. This is the correct command for this particular task because it skips the graphical  installer meaning it can run behind the scenes without target knowledge.

` `

__4. Cleanup__
We first remove the temporary directory used to store the java package during install then we use the bash command sed to remove the target from the sudoers list.

` `

__5. Function trap__
This is used to ensure the completion of the command.
